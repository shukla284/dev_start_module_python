# dev_start_module_python
This is a modeule just a free time project which consists of the python files in order to start IDE in such a way that it will careate new files for codeforces as per my updated files.
Consider there are presently 100 files starting with common prefix of type cf100.cpp then this modeule will start dev cpp and save the file with the same format and increased number.

Preparing to add functionality for the databases based on MySql database later on to make it more compatible with the other platforms and also carry details for the files and their submission.
